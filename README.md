## About
This project started as a university project to help lecturers demonstrate the application of several algorithms. Students are not directly in contact with the codebase of the algorithms themselves in this software but are instead working with a representation of the different steps that the alorithm performs when applied on a target (eg. a list for sorting or a graph for graph algorithms). This kind of representation requires some basic knowledge about basic datastructures.

## Available Algorithms
`sorting`
  -   `bubble sort`
  -   `heap sort`
  -   `quick sort`
  -   `radix sort`
  -   `selection sort`
  
`graph`
  -   `kruskal`
  -   `depth first search`
  -   `breadth first search`
  -   `dijkstra`
